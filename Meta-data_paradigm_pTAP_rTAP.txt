INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR BEHAVIORAL ANALYSES:

Logfiles: the relevant information are in the "Event Type" column:

For both pTAP and rTAP lofgiles
Three rows per trial:

- choice (aggression level from 1 to 4)
- outcome ( 1 = won, 2 = lost, 3 = lost due to time out or pressing too early).
- Reaction times: time the participant took to press the enter button. < 300 ms = pressing too early. 5000 ms = time out (the participant did not press the button on time)

Combine 2 and 3 outcomes to obtain the loss outcomes.

The final row in each logfile indicates the total number of won trials.

The provocation (choices of the opponent) levels in the rTAP are { 1,1,2,1,4,1,2,1,2,1,3,1,2,1,2,3,2,1,3,4,2,2,3,2,3,4,2,1,3,4,3,3,4,4,3,4,2,4,4,3 }

INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR EDA ANALYSES: 

pTAP EDA triggers: 
- When the choice starts (CODE 10);
- At the start of the empty field before the ball appears (CODE 20);
- Outcome (CODE 30);
- CODE 1-4 (Button press for choice)
- CODE 5 (Button press: enter)
